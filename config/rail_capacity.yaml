# Static per-departure vehicle capacities for rail lines.
#
# Values represent capacity for ONE departure in ONE direction (i.e., one train/tram/funicular vehicle).
# The forecasting pipeline converts this into hourly capacity via:
#   max_capacity(hour) = trips_per_hour(hour) * vehicle_capacity
#
# For lines with multiple consists/variants, we pick the larger (e.g., 8-car over 4-car)
# as a simple, conservative default.
